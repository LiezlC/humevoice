Yes please for the CLaude extractor to properlier populate the database. And something else I was thinking - the earlier community grievance appI started with to get the data goes to database thing sorted had a dashboard link on the user interface front page alongside the grievance submission form, which would allow the user (/ potential client) to see how the data is instantlycaptured to database and consolidated with rest. which, failing giving them direct access to m Supabase setup, I don't see another way let them see for this one. Is there a way you can reasonably easily integrate such a component here alongside the fact that the Code API part 2 makes sure the dashboard pulls out all the right information?


Thought process
The user wants:

A Claude-based extractor to populate the missing database fields from transcripts
A dashboard interface like their previous community grievance app (shown in screenshots) that can be added to the humevoice app so clients can see the data being captured in real-time
Looking at the screenshots:

Image 1: Clean submission form with language selector, name, contact, location, description, category
Image 2: Dashboard with stats cards (total, high/medium/low urgency), category bar charts, filters, and a table of recent grievances
They want this integrated into the humevoice app so that:

Users can submit via voice (existing)
There's a dashboard view to see all captured grievances
Shows real-time data from Supabase
Demonstrates to clients that data is being captured properly
Let me create:

A Claude API script to extract fields from existing transcripts
A dashboard component for the humevoice Next.js app
Instructions for integrating both
This is very doable - the dashboard will be a new route in the Next.js app that queries Supabase and displays the data.

PERFECT! Let me create both:

Claude extractor script to populate those empty fields
Dashboard component for your humevoice app (like your community-voice one)
This will let clients see the data flowing in real-time during your demo!

Part 1: Field Extractor Script

Claude API script to extract structured fields from grievance transcripts and update database
extract-grievance-fields.js

Thought process
Now let me create the dashboard component for the Next.js app. Looking at the user's screenshots, they have:

Stats cards showing total, high, medium, low urgency counts
Category bar chart
Filters (date range, location, category, urgency, name, description)
Table of recent grievances with columns for date, name, location, category, urgency, description
I'll create:

A dashboard page component
Stats cards component
Category chart component
Filters component
Grievances table component
This will integrate with the existing humevoice Next.js app structure.

Part 2: Dashboard for Humevoice App

Dashboard page component for viewing labor grievances with stats, charts, and filters
dashboard-page.tsx

Thought process
Now let me create the integration instructions and a navigation component to add the dashboard link to the main interface.

Now let me create the integration guide and navigation update:
