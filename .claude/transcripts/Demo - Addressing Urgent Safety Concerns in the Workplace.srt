1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,215
We'll jump right in, and I'll be in character for the safety scenario.

2
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:20,420
Absolutely. So here's the situation.

3
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,808
I'm Michael. And basically we've got a safety issue where we're being made to

4
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,661
work at heights without proper harnesses. This has been going on for a couple

5
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,800
months, and we had a near miss the other day.

6
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,080
I've reported it before, but nothing's changed, so I'm bringing it up now because

7
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,168
it's really a serious concern. I'm sorry.

8
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:39,814
I'm you're experiencing this, Michael. That sounds like a very serious safety concern,

9
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:43,488
and I'm glad you're speaking up about it. A near miss at height is

10
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,990
definitely something that needs immediate attention.

11
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,168
Can you tell me exactly when this near miss incident happened?

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,533
Was it within the last few days? Yeah,

13
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,736
absolutely. It was just a couple of days ago,

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,568
so it's really fresh. One of the guys merely slipped,

15
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,632
and if he'd had a harness, it wouldn't have been a big deal.

16
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,936
But since he didn't, it was a close call. And yeah,

17
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:06,190
it's definitely something that needs immediate attention, because it could happen again any time.

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,905
Thank you for sharing. That must have been frightening to witness, and you're absolutely

19
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,993
right that it could happen again. Can you tell me the specific location where

20
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:15,193
this happened? Which department or area of the worksite,

21
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:17,949
and if possible, what type of work you were doing at height?

22
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:22,147
Sure thing. This happened over in the roofing section of the west building.

23
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,804
We were basically up there doing some structural installs,

24
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:26,916
you know, placing beams and securing panels.

25
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,273
So it's that whole roofing area where we're working at height,

26
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:32,489
and that's where the near miss happened. I understand.

27
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:36,682
That sounds like exactly the kind of work where proper safety equipment is critical.

28
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:39,114
Can you tell me who was involved in this incident,

29
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,867
the worker who had the near miss, any supervisors who were present,

30
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,661
and if there were other witnesses who saw what happened?

31
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:49,889
Absolutely. So the worker who had the near miss is a guy named Jake.

32
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:52,446
He's on our team, and he was right there with a few of us.

33
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:55,203
There weren't any supervisors directly present at the time,

34
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,699
but a couple of other co-workers saw it happen, and we all talked about

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,616
it afterward. So yeah, it's definitely something a few of us witnessed,

36
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,209
and we've been concerned about

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,814
This is important information, Michael. I can hear how much you and your coach

38
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:18,643
care. Co-workers care about each other's safety. You mentioned this has been an ongoing

39
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:22,286
problem for a couple months. Can you help me understand what type of safety

40
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,658
equipment you should have but aren't being provided with?

41
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:28,840
And have you or anyone else reported this specific issue to management before?

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,079
Absolutely. So we definitely should have proper safety harnesses whenever we're working up there

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,892
at those heights. That's standard gear that just hasn't been provided consistently.

44
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:41,007
And yeah, we've raised it to management before, but it's kind of been brushed

45
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,117
aside or just not followed up on. So it's been an ongoing thing,

46
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:46,943
and we're just trying to get it addressed now before anything worse happens.

47
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,375
Thank you for being so thorough,

48
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:54,951
Michael. It's clear this is a serious ongoing safety issue that needs immediate

49
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:59,004
attention. Since you've had the near miss and this has been reported before without

50
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:03,596
resolution, would you consider this an immediate danger situation that requires

51
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:07,954
urgent action or more of an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed soon?

52
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:11,615
I'd definitely call it an immediate danger. I mean,

53
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:14,053
it's been ongoing for a while, but after that near miss,

54
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:16,175
it's clear this isn't just a theoretical problem.

55
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,637
really does need urgent action because we're at risk every day that this isn't

56
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:22,773
fixed. So yes, I'd say it's something that needs to be treated as urgent

57
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:27,718
right now. I

58
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:32,354
completely understand, Michael. This is clearly an urgent safety matter that puts

59
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:34,576
you and your coworkers at immediate risk.

60
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,967
This information is confidential and will be reviewed by appropriate personnel who can take

61
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,685
immediate action. Is there a phone number or email where we can contact you

62
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,595
for any follow-up? Or would you prefer to remain anonymous?

63
00:03:45,596 --> 00:04:11,607
us. Thank

64
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,656
you so much for sharing this with me, Michael.

65
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:18,909
I've recorded all the details. The immediate safety concern about missing harnesses

66
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,701
in the West Building roofing section, Jake's near-miss a couple days ago,

67
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:27,448
and your contact information. Your courage in speaking up could prevent a serious injury.

68
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:30,146
This will be escalated as an urgent safety matter,

69
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:34,786
and someone will be in touch with you soon at Entembo at example.com.

70
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,237
Mike, absolutely. I want you to know.

71
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:48,061
Absolutely,

72
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:51,396
and quick action of Dave Lott. You got it!

73
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:54,921
You're very welcome. Thanks for looping- You're very welcome.

74
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,786
Glad I could help out, and if you need to run anything else,

75
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:00,180
just let me know. Thank you.

76
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,456
You're welcome. It recorded it!

77
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,807
It's in the database! Yeehaw!

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,307
Hello.

79
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,788
I'm here to help you report a concern at work. Everything we discuss will

80
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:24,124
be kept confidential. Can you tell me what happened? Of course.

81
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,389
I can. So, I'm Grace, and the problem is that we're being forced to

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,165
do 12-hour shifts without getting paid overtime.

83
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,640
It's been going about three months now,

84
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,265
and if we refuse, they threaten to fire us.

85
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,451
So, it's a very complicated situation and I wanted to report this to see

86
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:42,039
if we can solve it. Thank you

87
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:45,204
for sharing this with me, Grace. I'm sorry you're going through this difficult situation

88
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:48,591
without getting paid This is very serious. I hope I understand better.

89
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:51,076
Can you tell me in which department or specific area of the company this

90
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:58,406
is happening? Yes,

91
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:05,735
I can.

92
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:06,286
This is happening in the security area, where we do the rotation of shifts

93
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:09,353
in the control station. Basically everyone who works in this sector is facing this

94
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:12,460
problem. So it's very specific to the company's

95
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,929
This is important information about the security sector.

96
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,489
I understand.

97
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,044
It's really a,

98
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,506
No problem. Let's go ahead.

99
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:35,718
I'm here to help with any other information you

100
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,701
All right.

101
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:42,016
No problem.

102
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:47,030
If you need anything else,

103
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,347
just let

104
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,766
Grace, we are still talking about your separation I need to know when

105
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:04,216
exactly this started. Can you remember if it was in August,

106
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,534
September, or what was the month when the 12-hour shifts without overtime started?

107
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:10,137
Yes, of course.

108
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:16,234
It started around August.

109
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,454
Before that, we had a normal schedule,

110
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:21,203
Thank you,

111
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:26,089
Grace. Augusto has

112
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,529
been around for long time.

113
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,529
Now

114
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,219
I need to know who the supervisors or chefs are who are demanding this

115
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,889
job. Can you tell me the names of the people responsible for these decisions?

116
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,889
Yes,

117
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:52,027
I The supervisor in charge of this is Mr.

118
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:56,120
Roberto. He's directly responsible for our security studies and he's the one who started

119
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,217
implementing these changes. So, basically,

120
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,375
his name is the main thing you need to know.

121
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,412
Entendiu. O Sr.

122
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:07,271
Roberto é o supervisor responsável.

123
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:12,755
Há mais alguém envolvido nestas decisões

124
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:16,263
sobre os turnos, como outros supervisores ou gerentes,

125
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,051
e existem colegas que possam servir. Sim.

126
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:24,448
Além do Sr. Roberto, tem também a gerente de operações,

127
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,258
a Dona Marta, que tá ciente disso e não fez nada pra

128
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:37,024
mudar, estou a ser.

129
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:41,227
E, com certeza, vários colegas podem confirmar porque todos nós estamos passando pela mesma

130
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,495
coisa. Compreendo,

131
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,852
Grace. Então temos o Sr.

132
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:49,916
Roberto como supervisor e a gerente de operações também envolvida,

133
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:53,404
vida. Além de vários colegas como testemunhas.

134
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:58,822
That a classic. Confirmando que se trata principalmente de um problema de salários.

135
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:02,302
Turnos de 12 horas sem pagamento de horas extras.

136
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:06,162
Isso mesmo. Você entendeu perfeitamente. O principal problema é exatamente esse.

137
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:11,986
Turnos de 12 horas

138
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,354
sem pagamento de horas extras. Então, na questão de salários e de condições de

139
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,618
trabalho

140
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:39,114
Perfeito,

141
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:42,587
Grace. Entendi completamente. Vamos registrar isso como problema de horas extras não pagas em

142
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,455
turnos de 12 horas. Muito obrigada por compartilhar e vamos garantir

143
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,247
que isso seja a********. Grace, ainda preciso de mais alguns detalhes para completar o

144
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,349
seu relato. Pode me descrever nas suas próprias palavras exatamente o que acontece quando

145
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,884
vocês são obrigados a fazer estes turnos

146
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,045
de 12 horas. Claro,

147
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,013
posso descrever sim. Basicamente, a gente chega para o nosso túnel normal e eles

148
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,309
nos informam que vamos ter que ficar 12 horas, sem opção de recusar.

149
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:20,338
Eles dizem que se não aceitarmos, corremos o risco de ser demitidos.

150
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,840
E no final não pagam nada mais por essas horas extras,

151
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,626
então no dia-a-dia a gente fica sobrecarregada

152
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:35,874
This situation is really unfair, Grace. Thank you for explaining how this daily pressure

153
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,103
Now I need to know. Do you consider this an immediate danger?

154
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,760
A continuous problem that needs to be solved?

155
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:47,482
Or a general concern that can wait Eu

156
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:51,832
diria que é um problema contínuo que precisa ser resolvido o quanto antes.

157
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,887
Não é exatamente um perigo imediato,

158
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:57,263
como um acidente, mas é uma situação injusta que está afetando todo mundo e

159
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:01,102
realmente precisa de uma solução rápida. Compreendo perfeitamente,

160
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:05,940
Grace. É um problema contínuo que afeta toda a equipa e precisa de solução

161
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:09,773
urgente. To conclude, would you like to leave a contact,

162
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:13,545
phone number or email so we can follow this case?

163
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:18,939
This is optional and your identity Of

164
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,427
course.

165
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:25,108
Posso deixar o meu email para acompanhamento,

166
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,748
assim vocês podem entrar em contato se precisarem de mais alguma informação.

167
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:31,209
Então, podem me contatar em graça e pintam o exemplo arrobaemail.com.

168
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,279

00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:23,829
entire security team. Take good care of yourself.
