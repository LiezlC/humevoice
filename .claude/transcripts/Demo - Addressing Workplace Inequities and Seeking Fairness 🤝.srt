1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,355
It goes to the foreign contractors. It's really discouraging.

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:06,395
I feel like no matter how hard I work, I'm not considered.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,904
Thank you for sharing this with me, Hannah. I understand how discouraging that must

4
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,619
feel when promotions and training seem unfair.

5
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:20,400
Your identity can remain anonymous. Yes, it's been, I understand that.

6
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:25,072
Yes, I understand that. With them,

7
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,485
what happened exactly? Can you describe the situation for me?

8
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:33,040
It's happening across three main sites,

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,451
Matombo, Chibwe, and Maputo.

10
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:38,981
At our operations center here, the openings get posted.

11
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:43,525
But when locals apply, they apply, the roles end up filled by foreign contractors

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,000
who didn't even meet all the listed requirements.

13
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:51,514
For example, the shift cord, And it's not just about the shifts.

14
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:57,135
The training manuals are clear, but when it's time to pick who gets trained,

15
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,378
the local candidates get overlooked. Like last month,

16
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,567
five slots opened for the new crane certification.

17
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:07,823
Four went to foreign contractors, one to a manager's cousin.

18
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,759
Locals with more hours on the machines weren't even called.

19
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:17,141
It makes us feel stuck, you know? That sounds incredibly frustrating,

20
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:20,058
Hannah. It's completely understandable why you'd feel stuck.

21
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,646
Stuck. When your experience isn't being valued like it should be.

22
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,169
Exactly. And it's not just about getting trained.

23
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,710
The pay is different too. For the same roles,

24
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:34,537
the contractors are getting higher rates and allowances.

25
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:38,405
I found out when a foreign hire asked me how to file his per

26
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,563
diem. Turns out he gets one,

27
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,902
and we don't. When I raised it with my supervisor in September,

28
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:46,057
he said that's just how the contracts are.

29
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,075
Can you look into who approved those pay and,

30
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:53,856
I can share names if needed. I've got the list right here from when

31
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,994
we talked about it last month. But first,

32
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,505
I need to know who makes these decisions at your end.

33
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:01,498
If you want, I can give you the names of the supervisors and HR

34
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,989
folks tied to those decisions. Also the posting IDs for the August shift coordinator

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,751
and the crane training list from last month. What details do you need first?

36
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,685
Thank you for offering to provide those details,

37
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:18,455
Hannah. That information would be very helpful for our investigation.

38
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,825
Could you spell out the names of those supervisors?

39
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:26,657
Okay, I'll make a note. Okay,

40
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,759
sure. For Mutombo Site,

41
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:33,527
Supervisor Maria Ntumwa. That's her name exactly as it appears on the roster.

42
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,673
Chibwe Site, Supervisor Paulo Mbeve.

43
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:40,096
Maputo Site, Training Coordinator Sergio Almeida.

44
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:42,336
Operation Center,

45
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:46,666
HR Officer Lydia Carmo. And for the crane certification list,

46
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:51,440
Manager Joaquin Nunez. Thank you for providing those names,

47
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,208
Hannah. Maria Ntumwa from Mutombo,

48
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,506
Paulo Mbeve from Maputo, Sergio Almeida at the training center,

49
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,616
Lydia Carmo in HR, and Joaquin Luna as manager of the crane certification

00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:08,165
list. This information is confidential and will be reviewed by

51
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:12,405
appropriate personnel. I understand.

52
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,706
Thank you for taking this seriously, Maria. Before we wrap,

53
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:18,432
do you need my contact? It's Hana Mautumwa.

54
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,570
I'm usually on the day shift at the office. I can also send copies

55
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,887
of the postings and the training list if that helps.

56
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,261
Yes, I'd appreciate your contact information.

57
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,448
It's helpful to have it on file. Okay, you can reach me at the

58
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,999
operation center. Sure.

59

You can find me on the roster. Great.

60

Right. I understand. Okay,

00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:44,226

Hannah. Your concerns are valid,

and this information is important. I appreciate

65

you saying that. I just want things to be fair for all of us

66

Thank you for listening, and for keeping this confidential.

00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:12,095
I understand completely, Hannah. Your concern for fairness is exactly

70
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,682
why this information matters. And yes,
