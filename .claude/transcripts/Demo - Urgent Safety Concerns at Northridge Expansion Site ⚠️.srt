1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:05,011
Thank

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,731
you for bringing this forward, Michael. That sounds like a very serious safety concern.

3
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,667
And I'm sorry you and your colleagues are facing this dangerous situation.

4
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:17,441
Can you tell me the specific dates when this has been happening?

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,897
You mentioned two months. Do you remember when it started?

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,432
Sure thing. Yeah, I'd say it started pretty much from the day I got

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,619
on site, which was about two months ago.

8
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:32,182
So we're talking roughly early April. It's been the same situation since then.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,917
Every day, same story, no harnesses. So yeah,

10
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:37,653
for about two months now, it's just been an accident waiting to happen.

11
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:44,318
I understand.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,198
That's a long time to be working in unsafe conditions.

13
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,409
Can you tell me more specifically where this is happening?

14
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,857
You mentioned Construction Site North. What's the exact location or name of the site,

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,299
and which areas or departments are affected?

16
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,193
Absolutely. So we're at what they call the Northridge Expansion Site.

17
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:08,587
Kind of a mouthful, I know. Basically, it's the new wing they're adding on

18
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:12,117
the north side of the old facility, and the main area affected is all

19
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,149
the steel framework and roofing work. So anyone doing the high-level structural stuff,

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,899
that's where we're at. In other words, it's not just one little corner,

21
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:20,899
it's the whole elevated part of the project.

22
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:31,395
This is important information, Michael. So this affects everyone working on the steel framework

23
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:33,656
and roofing at the Northridge Expansion Site.

24
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,786
Can you tell me who else is involved? Who are the supervisors you've reported

25
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:41,493
this to? And are there other workers or witnesses who have seen these safety

26
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:45,653
issues? Absolutely.

27
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:48,952
And so the main supervisor I've reported this to is a guy named Dave.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,834
Dave Henson. I've told him about it multiple times and so far no dice.

29
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,565
As for other folks, yeah, pretty much everyone up there working on those beams

30
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:59,050
and roof sections has seen it. We've all talked about it.

31
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,066
So it's not just me working waving a flag here.

32
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,530
There are a bunch of us who know it's a problem and have seen

33
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:04,310
the near misses.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,539
Thank you for sharing this with me. It's clear this is affecting multiple workers,

35
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,366
not just you. You mentioned yesterday's near miss.

36
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,125
Can you tell me what exactly happened? I'd like to hear the details in

37
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:24,865
your own words about that incident and the ongoing safety issues.

38
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:29,477
Sure thing. So here's how it went down.

39
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:32,385
Yesterday, one of the guys was up there on the steel frame,

40
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:35,370
and he slipped. Lost his footing for just a second.

41
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,376
If he'd had a highness, no big deal. But he didn't.

42
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:40,096
He managed to catch himself on beam, but it was a really close hold.

43
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:44,929
And that's the kind of thing that could have been a full-blown accident.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,586
And honestly, this isn't just a one-off. It's been the same risk day after

45
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,541
day. So that's the story in my own words. Just a close call that

46
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,631
really shouldn't have to happen.

47
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,399
I'm sorry you're all experiencing this.

48
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,916
That near miss sounds terrifying.

49
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:07,308
And you're absolutely right. It could have been much worse.

50
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,485
Given that this has been going on for two months with no response from

51
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:13,783
your supervisor, how urgent would you say this situation is?

52
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:16,193
Would you classify this as an immediate danger,

53
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:20,117
an ongoing problem, or a general concern?

54
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,647
Yeah.

55
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,909
I definitely call it an immediate danger. I mean,

56
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,506
when you're talking about working at heights with no fall protection,

57
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:32,096
that's not just a casual concern. It's an ongoing problem that's urgent,

58
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:35,440
because every day that goes by there's a real risk someone could get seriously

59
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,624
hurt or worse. So yeah, I'd say it's something that really needs attention right

60
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,283
away. Finally,

61
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:48,363
how can we contact

62
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:53,633
you if we need to

63
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,544
follow up?

64
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,083
You can provide a phone number or email,

65
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:02,419
or if you prefer // Your identity can remain anonymous.

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,862
Sure, you can go ahead and reach me by email.

67
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:12,191
I'm comfortable sharing that so you can follow up. Let's say it's mtempo at

68
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:15,162
example.com. And I appreciate you taking this seriously.

69
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,630
Let's hope we can get some harnesses up there and keep everyone safe.

70
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,048
Thanks for listening.

71
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:26,728
Thank you so much for reporting this, Michael.

72
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,743
Your courage in speaking up could prevent a serious accident.

73
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:33,480
resident, and protect your colleagues. I have all the information I need,

74
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:36,872
the immediate safety danger at Northridge expansion site,

75
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,159
the lack of fault protection equipment, and your contact details.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
This will be escalated as an urgent safety matter.

77
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:46,555
Stay safe out there, and thank you for doing the right thing.

78
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:51,920
Absolutely, and thank you for helping get this on record.

79
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,971
Hopefully this gets things moving and makes the site safer for everyone.

80
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,301
Really appreciate the quick response. Stay safe,

81
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:57,946
and take care.

82
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,623
care for your colleagues.

83
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,562
Take care of yourself out there and thank you again for bringing this forward.

84
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,639
Absolutely, and thanks for the kind words. It's good to know it's in the

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,738
right hands now. I appreciate you hearing me out and handling it.

86
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,010
Take care and let's hope for a safer site soon.

87
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:36,436
Thank you, Michael. I'm confident this will get the attention it deserves.

88
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,306
Here's hoping those harnesses are on site very soon.

89
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,708
Take care, and stay safe until then.

90
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,655
Absolutely, and thanks for making Until

91
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:53,482
then, I'll stay safe as best I can. Thanks again and take care.

92
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,202
You've got it, Michael. Keep looking out,

93
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:03,930
for yourself and your team. Thanks for being so thorough and brave and reporting

94
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:09,205
this. All the best to you. Absolutely,

95
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:12,048
and thanks for guiding this through. Really appreciate the help.

96
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,907
I'll keep an eye out for any updates. All the best and thanks again.

97
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,886
Thank you very much. That was great.

98
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,299
I'm still not sure if it's captured it.

99
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:24,671
The last database didn't work. Well,

100
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:28,038
captured didn't work. But now it should hurt,

101
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,234
but it doesn't seem to So,

102
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:35,818
was that more easy to hear, this different browser approach?

103
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,554
Absolutely. That was much smoother in my end,

104
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:45,716
and it sounds like the browser switch did the trick. I'm glad we got-

105
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,519
We can possibly have to do one or two more of these,

106
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,932
because I'm not sure if this still
