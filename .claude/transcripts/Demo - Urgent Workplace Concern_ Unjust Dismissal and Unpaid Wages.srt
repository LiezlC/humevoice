1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:05,011
Hello,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,350
I'm here to help you report a workplace concern.

3
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,520
Please note that this call is being recorded for documentation purposes.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,901
All information shared will remain confidential,

5
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:20,560
and you can choose to remain completely anonymous if you prefer.

6
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:23,280
Sharing your name is entirely optional.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,041
Can you tell me what happened? Hello,

8
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:30,106
I need to report a problem at work. Last week my manager called me

9
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:33,525
into his office, Told me to pack my things and leave immediately.

10
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:38,687
No warning. No explanation. I have a family of was my only income.

11
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:43,866
I don't know what I did wrong. I understand this must be very concerning

12
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,175
for you, especially with a family to support.

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,639
Can you tell me more about what happened in that meeting?

14
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:52,265
Did your manager say anything at all about why you were being let go?

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,582
Or was there any paperwork involved? Thank you for understanding.

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,985
In that meeting he just said, take your bag and hand in your card.

17
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:04,582
You're done today. No reason. I asked why and he said decision from above.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,323
There was no letter, no warning, nothing to sign.

19
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,139
Security walked me out after I turned in my badge.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,694
That sounds incredibly stressful. Being given no explanation,

21
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:19,100
especially without any paperwork or warning,

22
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:23,036
is concerning. How long had you been working there and had you received any

23
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:26,073
complaints or disciplinary actions before this happened?

24
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:31,166
I've been there just over three years. Started as a general worker and moved

25
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,894
to the crushing plant crew. I've never had a warning,

26
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:38,238
no written or verbal. My supervisor even praised me last month for covering extra

27
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,209
night shifts. Three years is a significant amount of time to be employed somewhere.

28
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,862
It makes this even more troubling that you had no warnings and were recently

29
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:52,384
praised for your work. Can you tell me the specific date this happened and

30
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:56,355
which company or facility this was at? It happened last week,

31
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:59,491
on November 7th, 2025.

32
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:03,107
I work at the Mavita Minerals crushing plant near Moatai's Ted Province.

33
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,541
The contractor on my contract is Zanbazi Site Services.

34
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,173
Thank you for providing those details. I've noted the exact date,

35
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,111
location, and contractor information from your report.

36
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,930
Can you tell me who else was present during this meeting besides your manager,

37
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,519
and do you know if any of your coworkers witnessed what happened or have

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,306
experienced similar treatment? It

39
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,808
was just me and my manager, Sr. Alberto.

40
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:34,616
After he called security, two guards came to the door and walked me out.

41
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,520
On the floor, a couple of guys from my shift saw me being escorted,

42
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,794
Joaquim and Mateus, but they didn't hear the conversation.

43
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,479
About similar treatment, two weeks before,

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,511
a welder from maintenance, Orlando,

45
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:50,530
was also told to go home suddenly. He said they blamed instructions from Maputo,

46
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,933
but he also got no letter. I can share their numbers if needed.

47
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:59,025
Thank you for sharing that information about Joachim and Matthias witnessing the event.

48
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,843
It's significant that Orlando had a similar experience recently.

49
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:06,082
This helps us understand if there's a pattern.

50
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:09,410
Before we discuss contact information,

51
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,411
I want to remind you that sharing your own name and contact details is

52
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:17,495
entirely optional. You can remain completely anonymous if you prefer.

53
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,866
Would you be comfortable sharing how we might contact you for follow-up,

54
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,383
or would you prefer to keep this report anonymous?

55
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,408
I can share my details, that's okay.

56
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:31,669
My name is Ernesto Niacole. Phone is 843-729-152.

57
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,227
I'm staying in Matundo near Tete Town.

58
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:37,151
If you need co-workers' contacts too, I can provide them.

59
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,919
Thank you for sharing your name and contact information,

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,775
Ernesto. Can you spell your name for me letter by letter so I can

61
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:48,073
make sure I have it recorded correctly? Sure.

62
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,995
E-R-N-E-S-T-O.

63
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,206
Space. N-H-A-C-A-A-E.

64
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,221
Thank you for spelling that out, Ernesto.

65
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,157
I've noted your name and contact information down below in our system.

66
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:04,805
Before we finish, I want to make sure I have everything clear.

67
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,173
You mentioned you worked at the crushing plant.

68
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:09,744
What type of work were you doing there specifically?

69
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,954
And were you paid hourly or hourly? Thank you.

70
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:20,395
I was on a crushing plant

71
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:23,367
operations crew, monitoring the feeders and conveyors,

72
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,812
clearing blockages, doing basic greasing and housekeeping,

73
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:31,243
and assisting during shutdowns. I'm on a monthly salary with overtime when we do

74
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:36,411
night shifts. Thank you for clarifying the details about your role and compensation

75
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:39,644
structure. Based on everything you've shared,

76
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:43,696
this appears to be an urgent matter since you've already lost your income with

77
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:48,672
no clear justification. Is there anything else important about this situation

78
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,981
that you'd like to add to the report? Yes. My access card and last

79
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,880
week's overtime weren't paid, and HR hasn't given me a termination letter

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,581
or reason despite my calls. I'm asking to be reinstated,

81
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,739
or if they're letting me go, to get proper notice pay,

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,629
accrued leave, and a fair retrenchment package.

83
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:26,320
I can send screenshots of my call logs and pay slips if needed.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,318
Thank you for providing those additional details. I

85
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,449
understand how frustrating this must be,

86
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:40,172
especially with unpaid overtime and no proper documentation.

87
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:44,417
This is important information that strengthens your case.

88
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:49,229
I have all the details recorded, your sudden dismissal on November 7th with no

89
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,150
explanation or paperwork, the unpaid overtime,

90
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:56,054
and your request for reinstatement or proper termination compensation.

91
00:05:56,206 --> 00:06:00,289
This report will be reviewed by the appropriate personnel and kept confidential.

92
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,856
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

93
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,733
Thank you for taking this seriously.

94
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:15,319
Just please note I have two kids and my wife isn't working,

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,930
so I'm really under pressure for rent and food this month.

96
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,207
If there's any way to speed up the follow-up or help me get a

97
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,759
letter from HR, I'd appreciate it. And I can share Joaquim,

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,815
Mateus, and Orlando's numbers if needed.

99
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,796
I understand the pressure you're under with your family situation.

100
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:35,244
That financial strain makes this even more urgent,

101
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:39,578
And I've noted that in your report. The information about Yohannam,

102
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,348
Mateus, and Orlando as witnesses is helpful.

103
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:45,111
If you're comfortable sharing their contact details,

104
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,352
that would strengthen the case. But it's entirely up to you.

105
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:52,019
Would you like to provide those numbers now? Yes,

106
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,693
you can add them. Joaquim, 84596-3127.

107
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:01,106
Mateus, 84403891.

108
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:05,631
Orlando, 826754103. Thank you for moving this

109
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:10,684
along. Thank you for providing those additional witness contact information,

110
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,966
Joahim, Mateus, and Orlando.

111
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:15,478
I recorded all the details of your grievance,

112
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,193
including your sudden dismissal without explanation,

113
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,060
the unpaid overtime, and, lack of termination documentation,

114
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:24,673
and your family's urgent financial situation.

115
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:29,398
This confidential report will be reviewed by appropriate personnel who will work to address

116
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,272
your concerns. Thank you for trusting us with this information,

117
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:36,272
Ernesto, and I truly hope this gets resolved quickly for you and your family.
