Subject: RE: GrieVoice Feedback - Technical Approach & Implementation Plan

Hi Thea,

Thank you so much for your incredibly thorough and thoughtful feedback! Your excitement is contagious, and your suggestions demonstrate exactly the kind of real-world expertise that transforms a proof-of-concept into a truly professional system.


YOUR QUESTION: THE TECHNICAL APPROACH

You asked about whether we provided standard Q&As or if the AI has pre-developed capabilities. Great question! The answer is BOTH:

1. Built-in Empathetic Capabilities (Hume AI)

The voice technology we use is Hume AI's Empathic Voice Interface (EVI), which comes pre-trained with:
• Natural conversation flow and turn-taking
• Emotional intelligence (detecting stress, discomfort, hesitation in voice)
• Multilingual voice recognition (currently English and Portuguese)
• Natural speech patterns (no robotic responses)

This is their specialized technology - we didn't have to build the emotional intelligence from scratch. They've trained their AI on thousands of hours of empathetic conversations.

2. Custom Conversational Guidance (Our Design)

What we DID provide are detailed custom instructions that adapt the AI for labor grievance collection specifically:

- System Prompts: Detailed conversational scripts that tell the bot how to open the conversation with confidentiality assurances, when to let the worker speak freely vs. when to ask clarifying questions, what empathetic phrases to use, how to handle sensitive GBVH cases with extra care, and how to close the conversation.

- Custom Tools (8 Real-time Data Capture Tools): save_submitter_name (with phonetic confirmation), save_contact_info, save_incident_date, save_incident_location, save_people_involved, save_category, save_urgency, and save_description.

As the conversation happens, when the worker mentions information naturally (e.g., "My name is Manuel" or "This happened last Tuesday"), the AI recognizes this and immediately captures it to the database in real-time.

- Post-Call AI Analysis: After each conversation, we use Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic's advanced AI) to analyze the full transcript, extract any information that wasn't captured during the call, handle nuance and context, and work in any language (it reads the Portuguese transcripts directly).

Three-Layer Redundancy:
1. Real-time capture during the call
2. Automatic AI extraction immediately after
3. Manual batch processing script as backup

This ensures we don't lose information even if the call drops or the worker speaks quickly.


YOUR SUGGESTIONS: ACKNOWLEDGED & CONFIRMED

I've reviewed your feedback in detail with my technical team, and I want to confirm: every single suggestion you made is not only valid but essential. We're fully committed to implementing all of them. Here's what we're planning:

✓ Column E: Name Field Enhancement
Your request: If no name provided, record "Prefer to remain anonymous"
Implementation: Update bot to explicitly acknowledge privacy choice, set default value in database, update AI extraction to recognize when workers prefer anonymity.

✓ Column F: Contact Information Split
Your request: Split into F1 (phone) and F2 (email), with "Prefer not to provide" option
Implementation: Database schema update for two separate fields, two separate real-time tools, bot asks "What's the best way to reach you - phone, email, or both?", defaults to "Prefer not to provide" if declined.

✓ Column H: Location Expansion (MAJOR UPDATE)
Your request: Split into 5 sub-fields
• H1: Office or Project name
• H2: Location where person is based (nearest town)
• H3: Country (auto-fill)
• H4: Company the person works for
• H5: Where did the incident happen (specific location on site/office)

Implementation: Complete database restructuring, new comprehensive location tool, auto-fill country logic based on phone number country code, language selection, or IP geolocation, updated conversation flow to naturally gather all location context.

✓ Column I: People Involved Expansion (MAJOR UPDATE)
Your request: Split into 4 sub-fields
• I1: Persons also impacted
• I2: Person that reportedly did something to offend (if none, record "none")
• I3: Have you reported this to supervisor/HR? (Yes/No)
• I4: If yes, name of person reported to

Implementation: Database restructuring for 4 separate fields, updated conversation flow with sensitive questioning, bot explicitly states "If you'd prefer not to say or it doesn't apply, that's okay", captures "None" or "Prefer not to say" appropriately.

✓ Desired Outcome Field (CRITICAL ADDITION)
Your insight about GBVH cases is particularly important. You're absolutely right that different cultures have different norms around personal space, and the solution should match the severity and context.

Implementation: New field for desired_outcome (full text description), structured sub-fields for common preferences (training/capacity building, removal from site, mediation, compensation, other solutions).

Bot conversation flow:
"Before we finish, I'd like to understand what outcome you're hoping for: What would you like to see happen as a result of this grievance? For example, some people prefer training for the person involved, especially if it's a cultural misunderstanding or lack of awareness. Others prefer the person to be moved or removed from the site. What feels right to you in this situation?"

For GBVH cases specifically, the bot will acknowledge cultural differences while centering the worker's comfort and safety.

✓ Grievance Process Closing Statement (ESSENTIAL LEGAL ADDITION)
Your suggestion: Conclude with project-specific process info and timelines

Implementation: New configuration system for project-specific timelines, database table for grievance_process_config (by project/country) including HR contact timeline, closure timeline, internal escalation process, government labor authority contact, and civil law options.

Bot closing script (customized per project):
"Thank you so much for sharing this with me, [Name]. Here's what happens next:

TIMELINE: Within X days, the HR team will contact you to begin the investigation. This is normally completed within Y days. If they need more time, they'll keep you informed.

FEEDBACK: Once complete, they will share the outcomes with you and confirm whether you're satisfied with the resolution.

IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED:
• You can follow [Company]'s internal escalation process
• You have the right to file a complaint with [Government Labor Authority]
• For serious cases involving GBVH or safety, you may have recourse through civil law

YOUR RIGHTS:
• Right to be informed throughout
• Right to confidentiality
• No retaliation for filing this grievance
• Report any retaliation immediately

Do you have any questions about this process?"

This becomes part of every conversation - ensuring workers understand their rights and the process, which is critical for trust and compliance.

✓ Excel Formatting: Text Wrapping
Implementation: Dashboard table updates with proper column sizing, CSV/Excel export functionality with text wrapping support, downloadable reports formatted for HR review.


IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

Based on technical analysis, here's what we're looking at:

Phase 1: Database schema migration (4-6 hours)
Phase 2: Tool schema updates - Hume AI config (8-10 hours)
Phase 3: System prompt updates - EN + PT (6-8 hours)
Phase 4: Field extraction logic updates (4-6 hours)
Phase 5: Dashboard & export functionality (5-7 hours)
Phase 6: Process configuration system (6-8 hours)
Phase 7: Testing & QA - critical for GBVH sensitivity (10-12 hours)
TOTAL: 43-57 hours

We're planning to prioritize:
1. Desired Outcome Field + Closing Statement (most impactful for worker trust)
2. Location & People Expansion (data quality improvements)
3. Contact Information Split + Name Enhancement (data management)
4. Configuration System + Export (operational efficiency)


NEW OPPORTUNITY: COMMUNITY GRIEVANCE AGENT

Your thorough review of the labor grievance system has got me thinking about a parallel application: a General Community Grievance Agent.

The Concept:
While the current GrieVoice system is laser-focused on workplace labor issues, many of the same principles could apply to community-level grievances:

• Municipal service complaints (water, electricity, roads, waste)
• Land disputes and property issues
• Healthcare access and quality concerns
• Education system grievances
• Local government accountability
• Community safety and policing issues
• Environmental concerns (pollution, waste dumping)
• Social service delivery (grants, documentation)

Key Differences from Labor Grievances:
• Different stakeholders: Community members vs. employers
• Different resolution bodies: Local government, municipal offices, ombudsman vs. HR/management
• Different timelines: Municipal processes may be slower
• Different escalation paths: Ward councillors → municipal managers → public protector vs. supervisor → HR → labor board
• Different categories: Service delivery, infrastructure, safety, governance vs. wages, safety, discrimination, harassment
• Privacy considerations: Some community issues are more public, others equally sensitive

Potential Shared Infrastructure:
• Same voice AI technology (Hume EVI)
• Same multilingual support (critical for South Africa: English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, etc.)
• Same AI analysis capabilities (Claude for transcript analysis)
• Same dashboard/export functionality
• Same mobile-friendly interface

Your Expertise Needed:

Given your deep understanding of grievance processes and your review of the labor system, I'd love your input:

1. Categories: What would be the primary categories for community grievances in your context? (We have 10 for labor: wages, safety, discrimination, harassment, etc. - what would the community equivalent be?)

2. Sensitivity Levels: Are there community grievances that require the same level of sensitivity as GBVH cases in labor contexts? (e.g., police brutality, domestic violence reported to authorities, child protection concerns?)

3. Data Fields: Looking at what we've designed for labor (name, contact, location, people involved, desired outcome, etc.) - what would be different or additional for community grievances? For example:
   • Ward/constituency information?
   • Previous attempts to resolve (who was contacted)?
   • Type of evidence (photos, documents)?
   • Number of households affected?

4. Resolution Tracking: Labor grievances have clear HR ownership. Community grievances might involve multiple government departments. How should we structure the "responsible party" tracking?

5. Legal/Escalation Paths: You outlined labor escalation beautifully (internal → CCMA → civil law). What's the equivalent for community issues? (Local government → public protector → courts? Or different per category?)

6. Cultural Considerations: Are there cultural protocols for community grievances that differ from workplace ones? (e.g., traditional leadership structures, community meetings, mediation practices?)

7. Urgency/Priority: Labor has clear urgency levels (critical/high/medium/low). Should community grievances use the same scale, or would it be different? (e.g., "life-threatening" for water contamination vs. "inconvenience" for missed waste collection?)

No pressure at all - but if you have initial thoughts based on your review of the labor system, I'd be grateful for your insights. This could be a powerful tool for civil society organizations, NGOs, community-based organizations, or even progressive municipalities that want to make grievance reporting accessible.
